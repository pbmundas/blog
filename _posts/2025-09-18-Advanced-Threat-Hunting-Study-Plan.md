# Advanced Threat Hunting Study Plan

## Overview
This study plan is a detailed, hands-on roadmap to becoming a professional threat hunter, covering all attack surfaces (network, endpoint, cloud, application, and OT/ICS) and advanced techniques. It emphasizes practical skills, automation, threat intelligence, and adversary emulation, integrating the MITRE ATT&CK framework, Cyber Kill Chain, and modern tools. The plan is divided into five phases, each with specific learning objectives, resources, and tasks to ensure mastery. Expect to dedicate 15-25 hours/week for 12-18 months, depending on your prior knowledge.
